My project will be a dodging game. The object of the game will be to dodge blocks as they fall from the sky. 
The user will control a circle at the bottom of the screen. The user will use the mouse to move the circle
around the canvas. The game will be over when the user touches one of the falling blocks. The score will 
be how many blocks were dodged or how much time as passed. There will be different difficulties and the more 
difficult will have different speeds and sizes of blocks falling. Also, a 'start', 'resume', and 'quit' button
will be on the window.
